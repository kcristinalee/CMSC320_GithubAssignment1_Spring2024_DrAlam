Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because it correlates to my major in computer science and my minor in
business analytics. I want to learn how businesses handle large amounts of data and process it in a way that 
makes it mean something. I want to learn about the mathematics, statistics, AI, and computer engineering
behind this.
